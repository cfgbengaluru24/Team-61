## Problem Statement
The Bits Bootcamp faces challenges with low awareness, high dropout rates, and the manual recruitment of students, necessitating innovative solutions to enhance program visibility, improve retention, and streamline recruitment for rural underprivileged students.

## Our Solution

Our project is an innovative initiative developed in collaboration with Joining The Dots Foundation, aimed at transforming the lives of rural underprivileged students by providing them with the skills and opportunities to become successful software developers. Our mission is to empower these students to break barriers and achieve their dreams in the tech industry.

In many rural areas, students face significant challenges including low awareness of educational opportunities, high dropout rates, and limited access to technology. Our project addresses these issues by:

- **Raising Awareness**: Implementing targeted outreach programs to inform students and communities about the potential of a career in software development.
- **Streamlining Recruitment**: Utilizing advanced technologies to automate and optimize the recruitment process, making it easier to identify and enroll talented students into the program.
- **Enhancing Retention**: Providing continuous support, mentorship, and resources to keep students engaged and motivated throughout the learning journey.

## FrontEnd
  The front end of this project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React helps in creating a dynamic and responsive user experience, making it easier for students to 
  access and interact with the program resources.
  
## BackEnd
  The backend of this project is powered by Express.js, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. Express.js handles the server-side logic and API endpoints. We use Prisma as our ORM (Object-Relational 
  Mapping) tool to interact with the Neon database, ensuring efficient and secure data management.

## Machine Learning Features

Our project incorporates advanced machine learning models for two key features:

- **Attendance Automation**: Utilizing Python's OpenCV library, we have developed a facial recognition system to automate attendance tracking. This system ensures accurate and efficient attendance records, reducing manual errors and saving time for both students and administrators.

- **Attention Monitoring**: Leveraging OpenCV, our attention monitoring model analyzes students' facial expressions and eye movements during online sessions. This helps in identifying disengaged students, enabling timely interventions to keep them focused and engaged in the learning process.
